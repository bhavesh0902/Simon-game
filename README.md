## About and how to play
This is an adaptation of famous electronic game of memory skill, popularly known as Simon game. The game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the user. A round in the game consists of the coloured button lighting up one button randomly, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

*Here, in the first level, a colour button would animate, say button 1 you need to click on that button. In the second level another button would animate, say button 2 you first need to click on button 1 than button 2. In next level another button would animate, say again button 2 so you need to click on button 1, than button 2 and finally button 2.
As the level progresses the sequence to be remembered increases, and if you select any of the wrong coloured button, your game will end.*
